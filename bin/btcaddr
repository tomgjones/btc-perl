=head1 NAME

btcaddr - get bitcoin addresses from private keys

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    btcaddr [OPTIONS] < WIFKEY

    OPTIONS
    -K         Suppress printing of the private key.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

btcaddr reads bitcoin private keys in Wallet Import Format on
standard input, and prints them with 
their addresses to standard output.

Output fields are separated by spaces, and records are separated by
newlines.  Fields can be selected and deselected with options.  No
matter which fields are selected, the order for any selected fields
is the same: private
key in Wallet Import Format, uncompressed address, compressed address.

FIXME: maybe remove option for compressed addresses, and have a 
separate program for that.
